# Discrete Choice Model Estimation with R

This book introduces Discrete Choice Models such as the Multinomial Logit Model, with an emphasis on how to estimate these models "by hand" using R. This is _work in progress_ and (quite obviously) is extremely preliminary.

While you wait for me to complete a draft, you should read any of these other highly recommended texts on Discrete Choice Modeling by folks much smarter than me.  If I had to recommend only one, it is Train's book.
