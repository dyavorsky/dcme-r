    "text": "Welcome\nIt’s a mantra that my mentors instilled in me in graduate school, and one that I propagate on my students today. I believe it in deeply. If you want to understand a statistical model, it is insufficient to interact with the model only through pen and paper. No matter how well you organize the subscripts or how masterfully you interweave elements of the Greek and Roman alphabets, you won’t really “get it.” To deeply understand a statistical model, you need to be able to simulate data from the model, and then take that simulated data to an estimation routine that enables you to recover the parameters of interest.\nThis is something you learn to do in graduate school. But, unless you have one of the most caring and pedagogical advisers, no one teaches it to you! Instead, it’s a skill that students develop independently and inefficiently between classes and assignment due dates or, in my case, after I was knee-deep in my dissertation research. There is a tremendous imbalance between how immensely important this skill is and the time and instruction dedicated to it.1 That imbalance is the motivation for this book.\nI address this gap in the specific domain of Discrete Choice Modeling. I do so alongside Kenneth Train’s masterful text Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation (Second Edition) freely available online at https://eml.berkeley.edu/books/choice2.html.\nTrain and I align in our thinking:\nWhat is “not that difficult” for an experienced researcher can be immensely difficult for a typical graduate student. The aim of this book is to ease that difficulty. I demonstrate R code alongside the math. You will see the mathematical derivations and pseudo-code in Train (2009) transformed into working R code. No mysteries will remain. A goal, in fact, is to provide you with much of the same instruction that Train’s students received when taking his course. To borrow a quote from Quintilian, Cobbett, Cooke, and many others: my goal is to take you through the process of programming the simulation and estimation of discrete choice models not so that you can understand, but so that you cannot possibly misunderstand.",

    "text": "Prerequisites\nThis book is intended for a narrow audience, predominantly graduate students with an interest in discrete choice modelling who will find value from seeing and interacting with the programmatic implementation of the multinomial logit and its extended family of related models. In other words, someone who read Train (2009) and thought how would I code that?\nWe will simulate data from the statistical models and then estimate the parameters of those models from the simulated data. And in fact, estimation of many models will require approximating one or more integrals through a second form of simulation (the one referenced in the title of Train’s book). We will do all of this in R, a freely available software environment for statistical computing and graphics. As a result, I assume you are reasonably familiar with R. If not, there is a tremendous set of free online R resources collected and organized at https://www.bigbookofr.com/. Popular books include Wickham, Cetinka-Rundel, and Grolemund (2023) and Wickham (2019).\nI also assume you have taken introductory statistics or econometrics courses, as the concepts and techniques taught there are foundational for understanding and estimating the discrete choice models covered by Train (2009). In particular, you should have no uncertainty about the difference between a model, an estimator, and an estimate. To briefly review:\n\na model is the set of mathematical assumptions about how data are generated,\nan estimator (or equivalently, the estimation routine) is an algorithm or function of the data, and\nan estimate is the result of applying the estimator to a particular dataset.\n\nIn my experience, students are often given a model and an estimator, after which much time in the classroom is spent deriving properties of the estimator for that particular model. Often a homework assignment follows which asks students to implement the estimator on a dataset to find an estimate. This approach puts almost no emphasis on the specification of the model or the choice of estimator. For example, should part of the model be specified as \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1\\) or should it be \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2\\)? And once we have specified a model, should we derive an estimator via least squares, the method of moments, maximum likelihood, a Bayesian approach, or some other way?\nIf my description captures your experience in introductory statistics and econometrics courses and you would like to review key ideas, I highly recommend Abramovich and Ritov (2023) on the topic of mathematical statistics, Goldberger (1991) and Kennedy (2008) for econometrics, and McElreath (2018) and Gelman et al. (2013) for Bayesian statistics. in this book, we will use Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian methods to estimate the parameters of the models discussed in the forthcoming chapters.",

The factors (\\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\)) relate to the agent’s choice (\\(y\\)) through a function \\(y = h(\\mathbf{x}, \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\). We assume for the moment that we know \\(h(\\cdot)\\) and that \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\) are length-one vectors (i.e., scalars) denoted \\(x\\) and \\(\\varepsilon\\).\nSince we do not observe \\(\\varepsilon\\), we can’t predict \\(y\\) exactly.

    "text": "1.2 A Simple Example\nLet’s first set up a toy example to demonstrate how simulation can approximate the \\(p(y|x)\\) integral. Suppose \\(x=0.5\\) and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is uniformly distributed between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). Define \\(h(x, \\varepsilon)\\) to be:\n\\[\nh(x, \\varepsilon) =\n    \\begin{cases}\n        0  & \\text{if } x + \\varepsilon &lt; 0 \\\\\n        1  & \\text{if } x + \\varepsilon \\in [0,1] \\\\\n        2  & \\text{if } x + \\varepsilon &gt; 1\n    \\end{cases}\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\nWe’ll focus on the outcome \\(y=2\\). You can probably intuit that the \\(p(y=2 | x) = 0.25\\) since only one quarter of the time will \\(\\varepsilon\\) be sufficiently positive to make \\(x + \\varepsilon &gt; 1\\).2 Nevertheless, let’s approximate the integral representation of \\(p(y=2|x)\\) through simulation to ensure we understand the process.\nTo walk you through the code, we first set a seed so that the pseudo-random numbers generated by runif() can be replicated exactly each time the code is run (even on different computers). We then specify that we will use 1,000 draws in the simulation and we create a vector I to hold our results. The simulation occurs via a for() loop where each time through the loop we take a draw of \\(\\varepsilon\\), calculate \\(0.5 + \\varepsilon\\) and check whether that sum is greater than one. If so, then \\(h(x,\\varepsilon)=2\\) matching the value of \\(y\\) for the choice probability we want to assess — i.e., \\(p(y=2|x)\\) — and thus we store a \\(1\\) in the \\(r^\\textrm{th}\\) position of I; otherwise we store a 0. We then average the values in I to get our approximation of \\(p(y=2|x)\\).\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nR &lt;- 1000\nI &lt;- vector(length=R)\n\nfor(r in 1:R) {\n    eps  &lt;- runif(1, min=-1, max=1)\n    h    &lt;- 0.5 + eps \n    I[r] &lt;- as.integer(h &gt; 1)\n}\nmean(I)\n\n[1] 0.258\n\n\nThe simulated value 0.258 approximates the exact value 0.25 and can be made closer by increasing the number of draws used in the simulation.\nNotice that we took draws of \\(\\varepsilon\\) to empirical approximate the integral of \\(p(y|x)\\), but we should not think of these draws as “data” in the sense of a dataset. They are ancillary numbers generated from the distribution of \\(\\varepsilon\\) that we use to approximate the integral.\nR users will recognize that we can shorten the code by taking advantage of R’s vectorized functions and its conversion of boolean values to 0/1 when used in mathematical operations. Here is a shorter implementation of the simulation; whether it’s “better” code is a matter of preference.\n\nset.seed(1234)\nR &lt;- 1000\nmean( runif(R, min=-1, max=1) + 0.5 &gt; 1 )\n\n[1] 0.258\n\n\nThat’s it. If you can generate pseudo-random draws from the density \\(f\\) and you know \\(h\\), approximating a choice probability by simulation might only require a handful of lines of code.",

    "section": "1.3 A Binary Logit Model Example",
    "text": "1.3 A Binary Logit Model Example\nAs an example of a model with a complete closed-form solution, Train provides the binary logit model. In this example, we’ll let \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\) be vectors of length two, and we’ll specify \\(h\\) and \\(f\\) as follows:\nThe “binary” part refers to the aspect of the model whereby the decision maker does one of two things; they either take an action (\\(y=1\\)) or not (\\(y=0\\)). To tie this model into a framework of behavior, we start with a utility function \\(U\\). In Train’s specific example, utility is specified as\n\\[\nU(\\mathbf{x}, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\varepsilon) = \\mathbf{x}'\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+ \\varepsilon\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a vector of observable explanatory variables, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is a vector of parameters that through the functional form \\(\\mathbf{x}'\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) effectively serve as weights on the covariates, and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a scalar index collecting the value of information used by the decision maker but unobserved to the researcher. Notice that we’re allowing \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\) to be vectors in this example, whereas they were scalars (or equivalently length-one vectors) in the previous example.\nIn this model, the threshold for action is 0 because the decision maker takes action (\\(y=1\\)) when utility is positive; conversely, when utility is negative, the decision makes elects not to take the action (i.e., \\(y=0\\)). Therefore we can specify \\(h\\) as:\n\\[\nh(\\mathbf{x}, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\varepsilon) =\n    \\begin{cases}\n        0  & \\text{if} \\hspace{1ex} U(\\mathbf{x}, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\varepsilon) \\le 0 \\\\\n        1  & \\text{if} \\hspace{1ex} U(\\mathbf{x}, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\varepsilon) &gt; 0\n    \\end{cases}\n\\tag{1.4}\\]\nThe “logit” part of the model’s name refers to the choice of \\(f\\). The binary logit model assumes \\(f\\) is the logistic distribution:\n\\[\nf(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{e^{-\\varepsilon}}{(1+e^{-\\varepsilon})^2}\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\nHaving specified \\(h\\) and \\(f\\), let’s choose some values for \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and use simulation to approximate the integral for \\(p(y|\\mathbf{x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\).3 Let’s pick \\(\\mathbf{x}=(0.5, 2)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=(3,-1)\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{x}'\\boldsymbol{\\beta}= (0.5)(3)+(2)(-1) = 1.5 - 2 = -0.5\\). We know from the closed-form solution to this model provided by Train that, with these values of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\), the probability the decision maker takes action is:\n\\[\np(y=1 | \\mathbf{x}, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\frac{e^{\\mathbf{x}'\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}}{1 + e^{\\mathbf{x}'\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}} = \\frac{e^{-0.5}}{1+e^{-0.5}} = 0.3775407\n\\tag{1.6}\\]\nWe can approximate this integral as before. Below I use the function rlogis() to take R=1000 draws from the binary logistic distribution, and I approximate the integral with the proportion of times \\(\\mathbf{x}'\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+ \\varepsilon\\) is greater than the threshold for action (\\(0\\)):\n\nset.seed(2345)\nR &lt;- 1000\n\nx    &lt;- c(0.5, 2)\nbeta &lt;- c(3, -1)\n\nU &lt;- as.vector(x %*% beta) + rlogis(R)\nmean(U &gt; 0)\n\n[1] 0.364\n\n\nOur simulated value 0.364 approximates the exact value of the integral 0.378.",
